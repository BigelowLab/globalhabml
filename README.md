-   [dplyr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dplyr)

-   [readr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=readr)

-   [tidymodels](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tidymodels)

-   [kknn](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=kknn)

-   [ranger](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ranger)

## Installation

-   Please
    [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)
    the repository, then
    [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
    your fork onto your machine in a directory you can remember how to
    get to.

-   If you do not use github, and do not want to start, click the green
    code button on this page and select “Download Zip”. Moved the zipped
    file to a directory you can find, and unzip it.

-   In RStudio, navigate to the location you cloned or moved the
    repository to in the Files pane. Set it as your working directory by
    clicking more and selecting “Set as Working Directory”. You can also
    use:

<!-- -->

    setwd(path = "your/path/in/quotes")

-   Once the directory the repository is shown next to the R version in
    your console pane, run

<!-- -->

    install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install()
